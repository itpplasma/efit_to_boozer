This program is intended to convert an efit file (real space) into
boozer coordinates.

Required(?) input files:

efit_to_boozer.inp
field_divB0.inp

The file 'efit_to_boozer.inp' contains calculation parameters.
The file 'field_divB0.inp' contains the name of the input-data files and
some switches regarding the calculation.

The file 'convexfile' describes the wall of the device. So as long as
the geometry remains the same, this needs not to be switched.

Output files:

box_size_axis.dat
btor_rbig.dat
flux_functions.dat
fromefit.bc
out.06

The file 'fromefit.bc' will contain the boozer data.
